# How to start

**Note** that this seed project requires node v4.x.x or higher and npm 2.14.7.

In order to start the seed use:

```bash
# install the project's dependencies
npm install
# watches your files and uses livereload by default
npm start
# api document for the app
# npm run build.docs

# dev build
npm run build.dev
# prod build
npm run build.prod
```

_Does not rely on any global dependencies._

# Configuration

Default application server configuration

```js
var PORT             = 5555;
var LIVE_RELOAD_PORT = 4002;
var DOCS_PORT        = 4003;
var APP_BASE         = '/';
```

Configure at runtime

```bash
npm start -- --port 8080 --reload-port 4000 --base /my-app/
```

## Environment configuration

If you have different environments and you need to configure them to use different end points, settings, etc. you can use the `./tools/env/config.json` file. The keys in the file are the different environments.

The can be specified by using:

```bash
npm start -- --config-env ENV_NAME
```

Currently the `ENV_NAME`s are `dev`, `prod`, `staging`, but you can simply add different key-value pairs to the `config.json` file in order to alter extra such environments.

# Running tests

```bash
npm test

# Debug - In two different shell windows
npm run build.test.watch      # 1st window
npm run karma.start           # 2nd window

# code coverage (istanbul)
# auto-generated at the end of `npm test`
# view coverage report:
npm run serve.coverage

# e2e (aka. end-to-end, integration) - In three different shell windows
# Make sure you don't have a global instance of Protractor

# npm run webdriver-update <- You will need to run this the first time
npm run webdriver-start
npm run serve.e2e
npm run e2e

# e2e live mode - Protractor interactive mode
# Instead of last command above, you can use:
npm run e2e.live
```

<!-- # Progressive Web Apps

`angular2-seed` supports progressive web apps with [angular/mobile-toolkit](https://github.com/angular/mobile-toolkit).

The seed can generate a file `manifest.appcache` which lists all files included in a project's output, along with SHA1 hashes of all file contents. This file can be used directly as an AppCache manifest (for now, `index.html` must be manually edited to set this up).

The manifest is also annotated for use with `angular2-service-worker`. Some manual operations are currently required to enable this usage. The package must be installed, and `worker.js` manually copied into the project src directory:

```bash
cp node_modules/angular2-service-worker/dist/worker.js src/client
```

In order to generate the manifest file run:

```bash
# ENV can be both prod or dev
npm run generate.manifest -- --env ENV
```

Then, the commented snippet in `main.ts` must be uncommented to register the worker script as a service worker. -->
